In case everyone doesn't know, the mechanics of the game snake consist of:
*   A snake that in controlled by the four directional keys (buttons will be added later)
*   The snakes head moves around the field followed by the snakes body.
*   If the snake hits the edge of the map or it's own tail it grows
*   The map has food scattered randomly.
*   If the snake hits the food, it grows longer and a new food is randomly placed.
