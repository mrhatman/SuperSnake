# Introduction
The goal of this tutorial series is not to teach you how to make a game in amethyst, but instead how to take a game you 
designed and make it ready to release. This tutorial is meant to bridge the gap between the Ping tutorial and making a 
game. I will be covering things like,
*   Ui (and Ui Prefabs)
*   Adding Multiple States
*   Loading Screen
*   Handling Settings
*   Saving a game to a file
*   Difficulty Levels
*   Language Localization

To this end, I have made a simple snake game and the first chapter will briefly discuss the workings of the game. Which 
takes us to the next section.
